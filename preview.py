"""Serve the built site for preview, without letting the browser cache the HTML.

Usage:
    python3 preview.py [port]          # defaults to 8904

Every asset the site loads carries a ?v=<build> stamp, so a rebuild changes
their URLs and the browser fetches them fresh. index.html is the one file that
cannot stamp itself, and `python3 -m http.server` sends no cache headers at
all — so the browser keeps its copy, keeps asking for the previous build's
engine.js, and a rebuild appears to have done nothing. The symptom is a page
that looks stale in a way no amount of rebuilding fixes.

A real host needs less than this: index.html with Cache-Control: no-cache, and
everything else cached as long as it likes, because every other asset carries a
?v=<build> stamp. A preview server can be blunter — see the deploy section of
README.md for what an actual host has to do.
